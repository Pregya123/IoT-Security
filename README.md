# IoT-Security
IoT (Internet of Things) security refers to the practices, technologies, and measures used to protect connected devices (smart home gadgets, industrial sensors, medical devices, etc.) from cyber threats. Since IoT devices collect and transmit sensitive data, they are vulnerable to attacks like hacking, data breaches, and malware.
